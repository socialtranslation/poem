野心

We had our heads down
我们低着头
baiting hooks—three wild salmon
给鱼钩上饵———三条野鲑鱼
already turned back that morning
已经在那天早上游了回来
for the in-season hatchery silvers
为了这产卵期的
now out there somewhere
现在就在某处
counting their luck—when
算着它们的运数——而
under our small boat the sea
就在我们的小舟下面，大海
gave a roll like a giant turning over
翻滚着波涛，像气势恢弘的辗转

in sleep, lifting us so high I thought
于睡梦中，将我们高举在空中，使我觉得
an ocean liner or freighter had
slipped up on us, the sudden heft
of its bow-wave, our matchstick toss
to depth we’d taken
for granted in order to venture there
at all. But when I looked up expecting
collision, the quash of water from their

blowholes pushed to air in unison,
a pair of gray whales not two hundred
yards away: “Look up!” I shouted so you
didn’t miss the fear-banishing
of their passage that made
nothing of us. Not even death could touch
any mind of us. It was all beauty and
mystery, the kind that picks you up

effortlessly and darts through you
for just those moments
you aren’t even there. Held that way
and their tons-weight bodies plunged
silently under again, I turned for proof
to you, but the clarity was passing through
as a swell under us again and the sky of the sea
set us down like a toy.

And that’s the way it was, and it wasn’t
any other way—just looking at each other,
helpless one thought and huge with power
the next. We baited up,
dropped our herring into slack water—
two ghosts fishing for anything but whales.
